/**
 * So... why do we need this two styles? Well, let's see:
 *
 * This was first made because a bug related to metamac-navbar. Bootstrap styles used
 * by this app would collide with the defined ones from metamac-navbar, causing the navbar to
 * have some bugs (shorter margins, the dropdown pointer was duplicating, that sort of thing).
 *
 * That was fixed by "scoping" the Bootstrap styles to a CSS class on the _root_ html element of
 * the app; meaning all child components will be scoped to that class. That way it would not affect
 * metamac-navbar.
 *
 * On the other hand, the app navbar is not under that _root_ element. That's a problem, because
 * we need Bootstrap for the app navbar too, so a new specific CSS class was created _ad hoc_ for
 * this.
